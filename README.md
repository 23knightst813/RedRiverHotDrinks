[Brief Here](https://notes.henr.ee/redriver-technical-test-breif-435kdp)

## Description

A full-stack application simulating the operation of a hot drinks machine.
- Frontend built with React for simplicity and efficiency
- Backend built with FastAPI providing a RESTful API
- SQLite database for storing drinks and their preparation steps
- Frontend communicates with backend to fetch available drinks and steps

~~No Idea how people can justify using a UI Library And a CSS Framework~~
